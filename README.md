# OrientationDetection

An Android app able to get the spatial orientation data of the phone. The detailed information can be found in [Introduction](https://github.com/UOETianleZhang/OrientationDetection/blob/master/Introduction.pdf), which is the mid-term presentation of my final project.



It is still under development. I may add some extra features this year.
